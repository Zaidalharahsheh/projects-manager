## CHALLENGES

We are able to get the information from the database on the front end, and also able to save the new data on the front end, but we struggled to get the information to POST to the projects or developer collections.
With more time we will fix this issue and clean up user experience.

## FUTURE EDITIONS

We will implement a login page, further collection reporting fucntionality and increased queries across collections with more time.
